# CL-OAUTH2


This is cl-oauth2, an implementation of the OAuth 2.0 standard
in Common Lisp.

It has been tested against the Microsoft Live and O365 (Graph) APIs and
at present implements the *authorization code grant* method.

This code is derived from cl-oauth written by Leslie P. Polzer. OAuth 2.0
differs substantially from OAuth 1.0(a), so there is not much code left
untouched, and I'm sure this code is much less robust than that of cl-oauth.

Any help to improve the code and implement a larger part of the OAuth 2.0
specification is appreciated.

See doc/ for a usage example.
